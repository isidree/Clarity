## Our project

### Introduction

A high portion of the world's population is really prone to being unorganized when it comes to accomplishing their tasks, and another high portion is also really prone to distract themselves whenever they are using electronic devices, such as a PC. We have apps to solve these problems independently, but what if we had a single application to solve both problems at once? Welcome to Clarity, the new application to both organize and avoid upcoming distractions from your computer.


### How does it work?

Clarity mostly works with a scheduling method. The user is meant to schedule any task they may want to accomplish. Clarity will ask for details about it such as the name of the task, when do they want to start doing it, and when do they want to finish doing it. Then, the user will be able to select either **Focus** mode or **UltraFocus** mode. Once all the data is introduced, the task will be stored in a local database, and the app will constantly be watching out the time. Whenever it is time to accomplish such a task, Clarity will block different stuff around the computer, depending on the selected mode. During the task accomplishment, a customizable Pomodoro timer will show on screen.

### Modes

**Focus** mode is designed for these tasks which have to be done with the help of a computer, or that must be done with it. A full blockage of the computer in such a scenario would be a complete failure for our app, so we've decided to include this mode. This mode will block any web pages that may distract the user whenever doing such a task. Is the user really prone to getting distracted watching YouTube? Block the site temporarily with Clarity. Does the user need YouTube for the task? Let Clarity know not to block it.

**UltraFocus** mode is designed for these tasks which don't have to be done with the computer, so it can involve any practical task: from school work, to carpenter tasks, to any other. The possibilities are limitless. As the name indicates, this mode is even stronger than Focus mode. This mode will temporarily block your computer, and it will only allow you to focus on your task, since the only visible window will be the Pomodoro timer.

### Release

The release date is unknown to this time; however, we expect to release it before 2025. The app is also supposed to be released in Microsoft Store, although this doesn't rely on us. The app will be free and will probably have no ads, as we do not intend to generate any money from Clarity.

## Our team

Our team is currently limited to one person, the owner. No personnel is currently needed, as Clarity is merely the by-product of a school project, and any help is forbidden. In 2025, the school project will have been turned in already, and if the project continues, more personnel might be needed. If this is the case, we will reach out.
